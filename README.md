This program takes in points from the user and creates a Voronoi diagram with the input points as Voronoi vertices. The program also creates a Delaunay triangulation, which is the inverse of the Voronoi diagram. To run the program, compile and run the Voronoi.py file. Instructions will be provided as the program is run, and a graphical representation of both the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation will be output.
